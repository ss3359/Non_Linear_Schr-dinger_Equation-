# Non_Linear_Schrodinger_Equation-
This is a repository on Non Linear Schrodinger Equation. This includes the Dirchlet Boundary Condition as well as the Gaussian Initial Conditions. The values were computed using the order 4 Runge-Kutta Method. I hope you enjoy reading my code. 

There is also Java code that uses the Runge-Kutta method to solve the Time Dependent Schrodinger Equation.
